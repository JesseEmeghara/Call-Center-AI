# Call-Center-AI
This project represents an advanced AI-driven web application harnessing the capabilities of Microsoft Azure's Machine Learning tools and the OpenAI model. It centers around the utilization of a Large Language Model (LLM) in conjunction with the data supplied. Its primary function is streamlining the management of call center data.The application operates by first ingesting call center data and transforming it into prompts and questions through cognitive services. Subsequently, it employs OpenAI's embedding techniques to query a vector database, seeking relevant information. Once the search is complete, the application returns well-informed responses to the user. In essence, this seamlessly integrates the power of AI and natural language processing to enhance call center data analysis and response generation, significantly improving efficiency and user experience.
